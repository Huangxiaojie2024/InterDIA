# InterDIA: Interpretable Prediction of Drug-induced Autoimmunity through Ensemble Machine Learning

## Overview
InterDIA is a comprehensive and interpretable machine learning framework for predicting drug-induced autoimmunity (DIA) toxicity. By integrating state-of-the-art ensemble learning approaches with multi-strategy feature selection, this framework provides accurate predictions while offering mechanistic insights through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis.

## Key Features
- Advanced ensemble resampling techniques for handling imbalanced data
- Multi-strategy feature selection approaches
- Interpretable predictions through SHAP analysis
- Support for batch processing
- Free online prediction platform

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 597 drugs (148 DIA-positive and 449 DIA-negative):
- Training set: 477 drugs (118 positive, 359 negative)
- Test set: 120 drugs (30 positive, 90 negative)
